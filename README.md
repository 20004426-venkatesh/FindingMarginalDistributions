# Marginal distributions and correation coefficient  

# Aim : 

To find marginal distributions and correation coefficient of joint probability mass funcition of two dimensional random variables

 
# Software required :  

Python

# Theory:

A marginal distribution is a distribution of values for one variable that ignores a more extensive set of related variables in a dataset.
The marginal mass function for X is found by summing over the appropriate column and the marginal mass function
for Y can be found be summing over the appropriate row.
